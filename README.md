# scikit-learn Decision Tree Classifier Example

This repository is created to demonstrate how scikit-learn can be helpful for achieving data science tasks.

To develop this classifier, only [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) is used. In here, a general purpose data classifier is implemented that can be manipulated easily to use for your own tasks. As I mentioned in the comments if you need some decision tree classifier for your problem, simply just change starting lines to fetch your data from its destination, then enjoy your classifier.

## Dependencies

* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)



## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmetCanSolak/decision-tree-classifier-scikit-learn
cd decision-tree-classifier-scikit-learn
python decisionTreeExample.py
```

##Do you have your own data to classify?

Change lines 6-8 to fetch your own data into dataTable and dataLabels. That's all you need.
